# Reimagining the Future of Work: Predicting Job Satisfaction of the Changing Workforce

## Abstract

The US workforce today faces pressing challenges such as decreasing participation and high turnover despite the substantial unmet talent demand in the job market. Much evidence has pointed to peopleâ€™s dissatisfaction with jobs underlying these trends. What constitutes a good job? While individuals may have different definitions, there are potentially universal criteria pointing to workplace satisfaction and overall happiness in life. The project uses the National Study of the Changing Workforce 2016 survey, a nationally representative survey of U.S. workers that includes diverse information on essential dimensions of work and life. Important contributing factors to a productive and happy workforce for the future are identified using the decision tree algorithm, with a prediction accuracy of 0.60. Valuable insights will be offered by our research findings to address the most critical challenges in today's talent development, retention, and engagement at both policy and organizational levels.


## Contribution

Evidence suggests that companies focusing on job quality tend to have better business performance. The Two Sigma Impact's Good Job Score, which measures job quality, consists of four dimensions of workplace excellence. Our research found that features such as opportunities for advancement, trust in managers, and satisfaction with earnings are connected to job quality dimensions. Additionally, community and self-worth emerged as important themes, highlighting the social and personal aspects of the workplace. By considering these factors, our model achieved a 14% increase in prediction accuracy compared to a baseline model focused solely on income. This emphasizes the importance of addressing multiple aspects of job satisfaction for overall well-being and engagement. Our research recommends expanding the framework for workplace satisfaction to include community and self-worth as additional factors. When applying our model to different contexts, it's important to consider the changing forces such as hybrid collaboration, online community, and industry-specific variations in work styles and expectations. However, our model can be adapted for more specific analysis in diverse contexts.

## Recommendation for Implementation

Our model offers guidance for policymaking at national and organizational levels regarding talent management strategies. The rise of flexible workers post-Covid and automation-driven disruptions in labor-intensive industries have led to decreased participation and labor shortages. Our findings suggest that non-monetary incentives, such as community building, leadership development, clear career paths, and flexible policies, are more effective for incentivizing participation, engagement, and retention. The workplace should be a space where workers can thrive professionally, socially, and personally, going beyond business performance alone.
